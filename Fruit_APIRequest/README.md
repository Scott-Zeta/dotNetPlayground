# What is in this Section?

So for HTTPClient Factory, the Page server-side play as a client to interact with another API endpoint. As when Browser user interact with the Page, they don't send the request directly but sending by the Page server.

Probably a good way for MicroService.

_I feel my brain is starting overwhelming.
Perhaps next step is to review other server-side structure like Django and Node._
